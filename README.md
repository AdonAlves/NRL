# NRL Predictive Model

The Goal of this predictive model is in an attempt to out perform the other members in friendly gambling game created by my girlfriends family. The purpose of this experiment is to see if I am capable of creating a model that will out perform the others playing, I do not condone gambling but this investigation is to see if I am capable of producing a model that would improve the likelihood of selecting the correct outcome. I have started this investigation as of Friday 5th of March, the first game of the season is set to start on Thursday the 11 of March. I have a short peroid of time to conduct data collection, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering and model production. 

## Information about this season
